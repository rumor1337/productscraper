<p align="center">
  <i>Product scraper for Latvian markets and websites that find the greatest deals between them</i>
</p>

## Why?
I developed this project partly due to a need for school and partly, just because websites such as **[kurpirkt.lv](https://kurpirkt.lv)** and **[salidzini.lv](https://salidzini.lv)** infuriate me with the fact that they do not have options to sort prices
and their cluttered design makes it a nightmare to find anything.

## Features

* **Adfree** No advertisements
* **Design** Modern design and no unnecessary clutter
